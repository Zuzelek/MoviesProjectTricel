Project is built using LAMP (without Linux :D)

I made the project run locally using XAMPP (Apache and MySQL)

Move the project files into the htdocs folder in XAMPP directory

Open your browser and go to http://localhost/index.html

Sample query to populate the DB:

INSERT INTO movies (title, plot, director, actors, year)
VALUES
    ('Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\'s Stone', 'A young boy learns he is a wizard and attends a magical school where he uncovers dark secrets.', 'Chris Columbus', 'Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson', 2001),
    ('SpongeBob SquarePants Movie', 'SpongeBob and Patrick embark on a mission to retrieve a stolen crown and save their town.', 'Stephen Hillenburg', 'Tom Kenny, Bill Fagerbakke, Alec Baldwin', 2004),
    ('Rush', 'Two F1 drivers, James Hunt and Niki Lauda, engage in a fierce rivalry during the 1976 racing season.', 'Ron Howard', 'Chris Hemsworth, Daniel Br√ºhl, Olivia Wilde', 2013),
    ('Barbie', 'Barbie ventures into the real world to discover what it truly means to be herself.', 'Greta Gerwig', 'Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling, Will Ferrell', 2023),
